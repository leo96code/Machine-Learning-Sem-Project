# Machine-Learning-Sem-Project-
In this project we will use any four of the machine learning algorithms such as, Decision trees, Na√Øve Bayes, KNNs, Random Forest, SVMs, Neural Networks etc. on UCI dataset. We will also use feature engineering and observe how different machine learning algorithms are affected
